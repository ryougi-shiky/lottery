## Deploy to Vercel

You can deploy this application to Vercel with just a few steps:

1. **Fork or clone this repository**

2. **Sign up/sign in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: Use your GitHub account to log in to Vercel.

3. **Import your project**: In the Vercel dashboard, click the “New Project” button, then select the repository you just forked or cloned.

4. **Configure your project**: Set up the project settings as required. Vercel will automatically detect the `package.json` file and suggest deploying with the Node.js environment.

5. **Deploy the project**: Click the “Deploy” button. Vercel will handle the deployment process automatically.

6. **Access your application**: After the deployment finishes, Vercel will provide a URL to access your application.

### Deploy Button

To make it even easier, you can add a Deploy to Vercel button to your `README.md` that allows others to deploy your project with a single click. Add the following markdown code to your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=<YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>)
```

Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>` with the URL of your GitHub repository so others can deploy your project directly from your `README.md`.
